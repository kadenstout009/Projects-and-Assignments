                Truly to get to know me and my personality, you first need to know that I love anything outdoors.
                I love the area where I live. I have everything as close as an hour drive and access to all my favorite places.
                My favorite things have to do with the mountains and being in the open space away from the city. 
                Other things that I enjoy are watching classic movies and trying new things.
